# Godot Console
A very simple addon to run functions in game. Might turn this into a more feature complete dev tool in the future, but for now this is all you get.

## How to use?
You add a Console node in your scene tree and press F3 to open and close the console.  
To add new commands, use ```Console.add_command("command", funcref(object, "function")```

## Planned Features
- Auto complete
- Customization options
- More later...
